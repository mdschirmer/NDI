# NDI
###Network Dependency Index for analysis of the connectomes:

- get_NDI.m: function to extract nodal NDI 
- get_NDI_labels.m: get labels based on midpoint between Gaussian centers and NDI scores (passed as argument)

### Main analysis scripts (see comments for explanation of how to run NDI analysis):

age_group_stratified_for_publication.m
all_subjects_for_publication.m

### Plotting functions:

get_hitmap.m
get_large_hitmap.m

### Region labels and removal of brainstem and cerebellum in .csv files

## Results presented here:
See https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.09935.
 	
# Accepted for publication in Network Neuroscience.
